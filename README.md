# Log_Analytics_Dashboard_PowerBI

## Context and assignment goals 🔍
This is an extract of a real assignment I worked on for a leading italian bank. In greater detail, the audit team of the bank asked me to analyze computer-generated records in order to identifiy unauthorized accesses to sensitive data by employees of a specific company department. To achieve this goals, I build a model to identify suspicious logs and then I built a smart dashboard aimed at showing results and allowing audit team to proper monitor the phenomenon.

## Data 💻
Data were provided by IT department regarding all system accessess related to the specific department in scope happened between 2019 and 2020. Input data have been completely anonymized since I deal with very sensitive information. 

## Results 🎯
Several suspicious behaviours were identified by the analysis, providing a baseline for audit team for further investigation.
